# speech

it is a simple cli speech to text code , we used covid19 api for it cause of availibility of free api keys but then it works for any speech and converts it to text.
Though it doesn't contain any terminate button it rather goes in continuous loop the reason is because initializing it again and again is a huge pain, thence i kept the loop thingy going on.
There can be many modifications that you can do to it, its just a basic normal speech to text thingy.
